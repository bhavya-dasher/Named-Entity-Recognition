# Named-Entity-Recognition

Problem statement or client expectation: Named Entity Linking System Generative AI 
(Idea: Build and train a language model like GPT-3 to generate clear and meaningful text. This project shows your skills in using advanced techniques for creating text with AI.

Dataset: Use large collections of text, such as BookCorpus or Common Crawl, to train the model. You can also improve the model for specific tasks by training it on specialized data related to your domain.

Explainability Module
explains why a particular entity was linked to a specific reference. This could be done via visualizations or textual reasoning outputs.
)

Description: First the dataset is gathered from kaggle name ner.csv which contains 4 columns in which POS, TAG and Sentence column are there showcasing the Parts of Speech text. This data is used for preprocessing, visualization and neural network implementation for finding the prediction in any sentence. For this, LSTM (Long short term memory) a type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model is used.

AI utilization in this project: For completing this task how AI can helped me in code generation and other task. It is very useful for us to use AI for solving projects
